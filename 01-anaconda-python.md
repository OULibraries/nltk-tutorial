## Getting started with ipython notebooks

## Startup

Install anaconda, anaconda has NLTK installed by default.

    ipython notebook

## Overview
ipython notebooks run as a web server on your local machine that we can connect
to with our web browser. We use them because they simplify the type, save,
execute cycle you'd typically use with a scripting language. We can do the save
and execute step with a simple shift-enter.  Each cell can be executed
independently so we're able to build up small pieces of ad hoc analysis. This is
not the place to write production code, but it can be a great place to test
ideas.

**Give a quick overview of document and code cells.**

Cells can be set in various modes. Documentation cells use a markup called
["Markdown"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
which enables you to make rich-text documentation with a simple syntax. Code
cells can contain python code and can be executed individually.  Code is
executed by the ipython kernel, and could in principle be running on a remote
computer.
